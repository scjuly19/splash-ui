# Splash-UI
 A pure CSS component library which contains ready to use components to help you build UI with ease.  

 The components are built keeping in mind the responsiveness and can be adjusted as per your needs by overriding the pre-defined style classes.
 
 You can find full documentation over here- [Splash UI](https://splash-ui-lib.netlify.app)
